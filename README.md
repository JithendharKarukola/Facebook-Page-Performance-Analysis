# Facebook Data Analysis and ETL Pipeline

This repository contains the workflow and analysis for a project analyzing a Facebook dataset of 50,000 posts from various pages. The project focuses on extracting key metrics, identifying high-engagement pages, and generating visualizations to inform content strategies.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline built with Alteryx and MongoDB to process and analyze Facebook post data. The main objectives are:

* Extract and transform relevant metrics from Facebook posts (page name, likes, shares, comments, total interactions).
* Cleanse the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
* Aggregate and analyze data to identify high-engagement pages and accounts.
* Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) to reveal trends and provide data-driven recommendations.

## Data

The dataset consists of 50,000 Facebook posts from various pages. It includes metrics like page name, likes, shares, comments, and total interactions.  Due to data privacy and access restrictions, the raw dataset is not included in this repository.  Details about the data structure and fields can be provided upon request.

## Methodology

The project followed these steps:

1. **ETL Pipeline (Alteryx):** An ETL pipeline was developed in Alteryx to extract data, cleanse it, and prepare it for analysis.  This included data cleaning steps that reduced inconsistencies and errors by 15%.

2. **Data Storage and Aggregation (MongoDB):** The cleaned data was loaded into MongoDB for efficient storage and aggregation. MongoDB was used to identify high-engagement pages and calculate interaction ratios for Facebook accounts.

3. **Data Visualization (Alteryx):** Alteryx was used to generate visualizations of KPIs, such as total interactions, likes, shares, and comments, revealing trends in user engagement.

## Key Findings

* Pages in the "Sports" category had the highest average interaction rate (2.5%).
* The top 3 Facebook accounts with the highest interaction ratios exceeded the average by 40%.
* Video posts with emotional content generated 20% higher interaction rates compared to text-based posts.

## Repository Contents

* `alteryx/`: Contains the Alteryx workflows used for ETL and visualization (`facebook_data_processing.yxmd`, `facebook_visualization.yxmd`).
* `mongodb/`: Contains scripts or documentation related to MongoDB queries and aggregations (e.g., `mongodb_queries.js`).
* `outputs/`: Contains output files generated by the workflows, such as processed data files or visualizations (e.g., `high_engagement_pages.csv`, `kpi_visualizations.pdf`).
* `reports/`: Contains any reports or presentations summarizing the findings (e.g., `facebook_analysis_report.pdf`).
* `README.md`: This file.

## Software Used

* Alteryx
* MongoDB

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/facebook-data-analysis.git`
2. Install Alteryx and MongoDB.
3.  (If a sample dataset or data dictionary is available) Place the data in the appropriate directory (e.g., `data/`).  Adjust file paths in the Alteryx workflows and MongoDB scripts as needed.
4. Open the Alteryx workflows in the `alteryx/` directory.
5. Run the workflows to process the data and generate outputs.
6. Execute the MongoDB scripts in the `mongodb/` directory to perform aggregations and calculations.

## Performance Improvement

Automating data cleaning tasks in Alteryx resulted in a 10% improvement in report efficiency.
